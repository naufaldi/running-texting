      "body": "<p>One of the big game journalism outfits did an hour long \"Let's Play\" with Jonathan Blow, where they showcased The Witness and talked about many of its design decisions.</p>\n\n<p>My favorite part was where Blow talks about how the puzzle idea started from an RPG-style game where you cast spells by performing gestures on-screen, where certain aspects of how you drew symbols (ie: speed, size) determined the traits of the spell cast.</p>\n\n<p>However, after exploring the idea a bit, he realized that it wasn't really much fun to do elaborate gestures when what you really wanted was to merely cast \"Fireball 1\", which you would do a thousand times in the course of the game. What was really fun was the lore-related ways in which you could teach spells to the player, by having them find them carved as runes into the scenery and such.</p>\n\n<p>So he made a game about that phenomenon of \"discovery\" instead. I thought it was brilliant insight.</p>",

My wife and I got sideswiped about a month ago, had to go to the ER in Austin.</p>\n\n<p>Got out, had no way to get back to our truck, nor to our house an hour outside Austin. Called Uber, figuring we'd at least get a ride back to the truck to get our stuff, and see if any friends could take us the rest of the way home.</p>\n\n<p>Despite nothing going on in town that night, and only being about 8:30pm, the app warned me of surge pricing, saying it would be 1.5x the usual fare. Didn't have many other options, and had been happy with Uber in the past, so went ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Driver was cool, and not only took us back to the truck, but drove us all the way home, complete with a flat tire we helped him change on the side of a busy, dark toll road, and running out of gas.</p>\n\n<p>Wound up being $98, and that guy really earned his tip. I still wonder if the fact that we called from the exit of the ER triggered surge pricing, though. Not a great time to experiment, but I could've probably walked a few blocks and tried again, if my wife wasn't in the shape she was in at the time.</p>",

When I look at similarly sized OO code bases produced by people with similar levels of passion and expertise, the code base is also very good.</p>\n\n<p>The terrible Java code I've seen, on the other hand, mostly comes from less experienced people whose priorities are things like \"keep boss happy\", \"put in all required hours\", and \"comply with project plan\". Which is, sadly, the average case in the industry.</p>\n\n<p>So I'm wondering: What happens if some functional language becomes mainstream?

They probably just want to get a job done, and they want to figure out if your tool's a good fit. In all likelihood, maybe they don't like Node. I would assume that you're aware of Autobahn's existence because you link to your library passing its test suite. Did you consider that perhaps your library could be wrapped and make Autobahn-Python's story even stronger? Think about it this way:</p>\n\n<p>You've written what potentially appears to be a promising library. Great! In fact, it seems so promising that people are trying to find the equivalent in the language of their choice. Even better! Why not encourage them to write a wrapper for your fine library in their language of choice? Not everyone uses Node, after all. Maybe that person asking for equivalents in Python would've written a binding if you told them \"Hey, you could try to do this in pure python but because of the relative performance of my library, you might want to consider writing a binding to \u00b5ws.\" All it takes is a little bit more thought before you type out a response.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not telling you to censor yourself. I'm telling you to stop worrying about explaining yourself, and start thinking about being more helpful. You might have written the library, but other people are going to be the ones who use it. They're going to ask you questions, and you're going to think some of those questions are stupid. It's okay. But if you try to be helpful to them even if you think their questions are stupid, you'll spend far less time writing defensive comments on HN, and far more time watching adoption for your library grow, which I assume is something you may want.</p>\n\n<p>Best of luck!</p>",
